# Bridge Defect Detection using AI

### 1. Project Overview
This project is developed for the **NXP Hackathon 2026** to automate the detection of structural defects in bridges. Using Computer Vision, the model classifies bridge surface images into categories like Crack, Clean, etc.

### 2. Tech Stack & Algorithm
* **Model Architecture:** MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning).
* **Framework:** PyTorch.
* **Platform:** Google Colab with T4 GPU.
* **Export Format:** ONNX (Optimized for NXP eIQ Toolkit).

### 3. Key Results
* **Accuracy:** The model achieved high classification accuracy (95%+).
* **Metrics:** Detailed confusion matrix and classification reports were generated to validate performance.

### 4. Dataset Information
Due to GitHub's file size limits, the complete dataset zip is available via Google Drive.
